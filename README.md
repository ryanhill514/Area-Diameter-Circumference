# Area-Diameter-Circumference

A simple executable written in C++ to calculate either area, diameter, or circumference given the radius. This was a class project designed to help with quick calculations for various questions envolving circles and ring shapes. It is a pretty straight forward program that asks for the calculation you wish to make and the value of the radius. The program will run once and return the value of the calculation you selected.This was written using Dev-C++ 5.11
