# Area-Diameter-Circumference

A simple executable written in C++ to calculate either area, diameter, or circumference given the radius. This was a class project designed to help with quick calculations for various questions envolving circles and ring shapes. It is a pretty straight forward program that asks for the calculation you wish to make followed by the value of the radius. The program will run once and return the answer of the calculation you selected. This was written using Dev-C++ 5.11

## Getting Started

* The executable version of the program can be downloaded from the main page of the repository and can easily be ran on your desktop. I recommend trying out the program first to see exactly how it works. The instructions should be simple to understand, and by running the program a few times one can begin to see all the possibilities for improvement.

### Prerequisites & Installation

* The .cpp file provided can be dowloaded and opened in a source code editor. There you can view the main body of code and the functions that are used. The additional comments in the code should clarify the purpose of the various lines and paint a good picture of what the program is doing.
* I use Notepad++ for all my random code editing. A link to download Notepad++ is provided in the 'Built With' section. On the download page for Notepad++ there are various download options. Pick the one that applies best to you, but I recommend 32-bit with an installer for ease.
* The .cpp file can also be opened in a compiler where it can be edited, improved, and tested for validity. You can then submit your edits back here.
* I use Dev-C++ as my main editor and compiler of the code. A link to download Dev-C++ is also provided in the 'Built With' section, as well as a requirements list. On the download page for Dev-C++ there are three download options. I recommend downloading the first option which includes Mingw compiler system.
* Please feel free to suggest your own edits and improvements to the code.
